Evaluate the following Boolean expressions for a Robot. Assume the robot is on intersection (1, 5) facing north. There is a Wall immediately in front of it. 
In each case your answer will be either true or false.
this.getAvenue() > 0 True, he is on avenue 5
this.getAvenue() <= 5 True, he is on avenue 5
this.getStreet() != 1 False, his street is 1
!(this.getStreet() == 1) false, his street his 1
this.frontIsClear() False, there is a wall in front of him
!this.frontIsClear() True, his front is not clear
this.frontIsClear() == false  True, his front is not clear
2. Consider the following if-else statements. Do they behave the same way or differently? Justify your answer.

Statement 1
if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}  


Yes they behave the same, if he can pick thing he turns right and if he cant he turns left

if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}
